# Inventory-Pi
Simple inventory management software.

## The idea
To build a simple inventory management software on a small Raspberry Pi. The devide would be installed near the access point to the inventory. Barcodes would be used to enter commands to minimize keyboard inputs.

## The goal
Just a simple project to learn more about
* Python,
* SQLite,
* SQLalchemy and ORMs,
* Raspberry Pi,
* git and GitHub,
* APIs.

## Installation
* Clone the repo locally on your device.
* Print the bar codes and keep near the scanning device.
* Run the script and scan the appropriate bar code.
* Scan your items.

## TODO
* Make API calls to barcodelookup.com to simplify most new item addition to DB.
* Web app to consult DB on phone, ask for low or out of stock items, etc.
